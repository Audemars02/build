TITLE = Advanced New Card per Convo
DESCRIPTION = Creates a setting in messaging preferences to open conversations in a new window.  Improved over previous iterations in that notifications will use new window or open new window as needed and opened windows don't force themselves to focus.  Great for webOS 2.1's stacks.<br/><br/>Note to HPalm: Feel free to implement this feature in future webOS versions. :-)
