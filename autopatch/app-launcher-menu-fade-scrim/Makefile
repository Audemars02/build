TITLE = Menu Fade Scrim
DESCRIPTION = If you just want to get rid of the fade, just install the patch, if you want a custom scrim just place it in the scrims folder used for my other patches.<br/>This will also remove the top fade in the messaging app!<br/><br/>If you are not using one of my scrims patches (shame on you lol)then just create a folder on the usb drive of your Pre called scrims and put the .pngs in there.<br/><br/>The affected files are:<br/>command-menu-gradient.png Fade at the bottom of most apps.<br/>view-menu-gradient.png Fade at the top of the messaging app.<br/><br/>This patch adds the ability to either make your launcher clear or add a background to the launcher by adding it to the scrims folder on the usb drive.<br/>If you wish to change the launcher scrim,<br/>The file is called launcher-scrim.png<br/><br/>I have created a dropbox scrim repository so if you would like to be able to add to or use premade scrims then pm me or email me your email address i will send you an invite.<br/>Hopefully this will cut down on misspelled files or incorrect extensions.<br/><br/>2sslow@gmail.com
