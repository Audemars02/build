PATCH = phone/${NAME}.patch
TITLE = Open to Call Log
DESCRIPTION = This patch causes the phone app to always open up to the Call Log scene. It makes the Call Log scene the default back view for the Dialpad and Favorites scenes. It makes it so that if you swipe back on the Call Log scene, the app will go into card view.<br/><br/>(Note: Open drawers no longer close.)
