TITLE = Neato that URL
DESCRIPTION = Adds a 'Neato! it' option in the browser page menu to send the URL to your PC.<br/>Probably not compatible with a lot of other browser patches, I will be combining some just wanted to get this out there.<br/>You will need version 0.9.0 or higher of Neato!<br/>Make sure Neato! is already running before trying to Neato! a URL.<br/>Lastly thanks to @zhephree for providing a cross app api.
