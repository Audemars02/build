PATCH = app-launcher/${NAME}.patch
TITLE = 4x4 icons v4 No Arrows Plus More
DESCRIPTION = This will modify the App launcher to display 4x4.  The size and spacing are just right, and there are no scroll arrows.  I also added in the 'add/delete pages' patch and 'gesture tap for info/delete' patch, since they touch the same files.
