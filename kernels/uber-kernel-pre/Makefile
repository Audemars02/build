DESCRIPTION = A collection of all the best kernel improvements for the Palm Pre/Pre+, rolled into a single OTA-safe installation package.<br>\

Current additions include:<ul>\
<li>720MHz and 800MHz kernel operating points (OPP6 and OPP7 for VDD1), based on the open source OMAP3440 kernel port, ported to the Palm Pre/Pre+ by uNiXpSyChO</li>\
<li>All standard Linux 2.6.24 cpufreq governors made available for selection via the Govnah application</li>\
<li>The OMAP3430 internal CPU temperature sensor is made available for measuring the true CPU temperature, ported to the Palm Pre/Pre+ by ka6sox & rwhitby</li>\
<li>A new <b>screenstate</b> governor created by uNiXpSyChO specifically for the Palm Pre/Pre+ which runs at a higher speed when the screen is on, and a lower speed when the screen is off</li>\
